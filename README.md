##Tutorial in words:
Install [Tapermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
Enable Developer mode in extensions of your browser. (Tapermonkey needs this in order to work!)
Go to [GreasyFork](https://greasyfork.org/cs/scripts/528298-pterosort-category) and install this script.
Open Tapermonkey dashboard and click on PteroSort Category this should bring you to code of the script we then want to click on settings.
In settings find Includes/Excludes and in there box named User matches clicl Add... button enter you panel link in this format "https://panel.your-server.eu/" then click ok.
Now if you did everything correctly and you return to your panel and refresh the page you should see the addon active.

If you dont see it the addon active on the page check in Tapermonkey extension that the script is active and if you dont see it at all then you entered you panel link wrong.
